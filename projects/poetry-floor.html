          Text installation, 2025
</p><p>
Park Life is a site-responsive text installation developed in response to an urban garden situated directly beside a public park, separated only by a wooden fence. The work reflects on the relationship between these adjacent but distinct spaces, and on what is visible, shared, or withheld across that boundary.
</p><p>
The installation consists of five engraved poems set into silver acetate panels placed directly on the ground in space, arranged so that visitors encountered them underfoot, reading them as they might paving slabs or pathways. Each panel includes a single engraved line running through the text, functioning both as a visual fracture and a connective thread across the work.
</p><p>
The poems were developed through a daily, ritualised writing practice in the period leading up to the exhibition, offering brief observations and moments of attention; glimpses of lives, objects, and movements beyond the fence. Influences include the attentiveness and immediacy of Frank O’Hara’s lunchtime poems, and Gertrude Stein’s Tender Buttons, particularly in their treatment of language as a way of lingering with people and things.
</p><p>
By placing poetry on the ground to be walked over rather than elevated for display, Park Life proposes reading as a bodily, durational activity, embedded in everyday movement and shared space.
