        <p>
          Growing Sculptures from the Land is a long-term collaborative practice developed by Toby Tobias Kidd and Adele Lazzeri, working across site-specific sculpture, performance, and ecological research. The project is shaped through residencies and sustained engagement with specific landscapes, including Bastioni Association (Florence), Live Art Ireland at Milford House, and Antony Gormley's High House in Norfolk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using materials gathered from the land, the collaborators create sculptural interventions and temporary structures that leave traces within the landscape and are often gradually reabsorbed into their environments. The work operates through processes of rewilding, attention, and cohabitation, foregrounding the relationship between artistic authorship, ecological systems, and time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside site-based works, the project has developed a series of video and performances combining live music improvisation, graphic scores, and sculpture, which have been shown/performed at various places including the Brain Rot performance at Cafe Oto with guest musicians Chris Cundy and Utopian Realism.
        </p>
        <p>
         The collaboration is informed by shared philosophical research, drawing on ecological and materialist thinking around land, temporality, and collective futures, informed by Lazzeri's background at Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy (CRMEP).
