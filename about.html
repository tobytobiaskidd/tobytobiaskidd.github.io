        <p>
         Toby Tobias Kidd is an artist and musician whose practice spans contemporary art, music, performance, and collaborative research. He works with sound, text, video, and live performance as materials, developing projects through collective processes, public programmes, and long-term collaborations.
        </p>
        <p>
          He trained at the Royal College of Art, and his recent residencies and exhibitions include Anthony Gormley’s High House, Caroline Woolard’s Pollinator residency with Void Gallery, exhibitions at Hypha Studios and Pi Artworks, as well as performances at Filet Space and live broadcasts on BBC Radio.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the past five years, Kidd has curated and run a summer exhibition programme with his collaborative micro-institution, Pragmata Collective, supporting both emerging and established artists through research-led and site-responsive projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside his own practice, he develops and contributes to collaborative platforms, including leading the Public Art & The Economics of Imagination podcast in collaboration with King’s College London Centre for Philosophy & Art, and projects connected to public and civic contexts, such as Camden Council’s Toolkit for Interpreting Statues and Memorials, events with Coventry University PhD researchers, and initiatives with Future Narratives Lab. His work explores how artistic practice can operate simultaneously as authorship, research, and shared infrastructure.
